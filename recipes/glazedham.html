    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (10 pound) fully-cooked, bone-in ham</li>
      <li>1¼ cups packed dark brown sugar</li>
      <li>⅓ cup pineapple juice</li>
      <li>⅓ cup honey, or more to taste</li>
      <li>⅓ large orange</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Dijon mustard</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon ground cloves</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons lemon juice, or to taste (Optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Place ham on a rack
        set in a roasting pan.
      </li>
      <li>Bake uncovered in the preheated oven for 2 hours.</li>
      <li>
        While the ham is baking, combine brown sugar, pineapple juice, and 1/3
        cup honey in a saucepan. Zest orange into the saucepan, then squeeze in
        the juice. Add Dijon mustard and ground cloves; whisk mixture over
        medium-high heat as it comes to a boil. <br />Reduce heat and simmer
        until glaze thickens slightly, 5 to 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Taste glaze and adjust seasonings. Add lemon juice for more tang, or
        honey to make it sweeter. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove ham from the oven after it has baked for 2 hours. Brush with
        glaze. Bake for an additional 30 to 45 minutes, brushing ham with glaze
        every 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
